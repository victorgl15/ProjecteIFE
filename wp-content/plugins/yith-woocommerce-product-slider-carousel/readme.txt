2. Upload the plugin folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
3. Activate `YITH WooCommerce Product Slider Carousel` from Plugins page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the main changes in plugin translation? =
= Translation issue with the  1.0.8 =
In order to import correctly the plugin strings in the new system, we had to change the text domain form 'ywcps' to 'yith-woocommerce-product-slider-carousel'. Once the plugin will be imported in the translate.wordpress.org system, the translations of other languages will be downloaded directly from WordPress, without using any .po and .mo files. Moreover, users will be able to participate in a more direct way to plugin translations, suggesting texts in their languages in the dedicated tab on translate.wordpress.org. During this transition step, .po and .mo files will be used as always, but in order to be recognized by WordPress, they will need to have a new nomenclature, renaming them in: yith-woocommerce-product-slider-carousel-.po yith-woocommerce-product-slider-carousel-.mo. For example, if your language files were named ywcps-en_GB.po and ywcps-en_GB.mo, you will just have to rename them respectively as yith-woocommerce-product-slider-carousel-en_GB.po and yith-woocommerce-product-slider-carousel-en_GB.mo.

= Is the plugin compatible with all WordPress themes? =

Compatibility with all themes is impossible, because they are too many, but generally if themes are developed according to WordPress and WooCommerce guidelines, YITH plugins are compatible with them.
Yet, we can grant compatibility with themes developed by YIThemes, because they are constantly updated and tested with our plugins. Sometimes, especially when new s are released, it might only require some time for them to be all updated, but you can be sure that they will be tested and will be working in a few days.

= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =

If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow this preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that you plugin , your theme  and your WordPress and WooCommerce  (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.

If none of the previous listed actions helps you solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce s you are using and any other information that might help us solve your problem as quickly as possible. Thanks!
